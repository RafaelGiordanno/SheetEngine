# SheetEditor

Yet another 2D game editor for retro styled games based on OpenGL.

A compreensive readme coming as soon as features are implemented.

### TO DO list
- [ ] Entity placement with support for custom properties stored and loaded from
JSON files
- [ ] Tile and object based level creation
- [ ] Streaming of levels

And more things as first things get done.

The editor is implemented with Java and LibGDX, but another version based on
C++, SFML and IMGUI is being developed in parallel. Consider this to be the open
source counterpart easier to build and prototype counterpart.

Uses JDK 1.8 and Eclipse 2019.3
